# Gesture-based Volume Control with Python üñêÔ∏èüîä

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Gesture-Based Volume Control Python project! This project brings to you an innovative way to control the volume of your device using hand gestures. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, the script tracks the user's hand movements through the device camera and adjusts the volume accordingly. Say goodbye to fumbling for the volume buttons; just raise your hand and let the code handle the rest!

## 2. Description

This Python script utilizes the power of OpenCV for image processing and the Mediapipe library for hand tracking. The combination of these libraries enables real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition from the webcam feed. As the distance between the thumb and index finger increases, the volume increases and vice versa.
